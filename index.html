<h1>welcome</h1>
<p>hell0</p>
<p>this website is a marvel of webdev. this is definitely not temporary or in works, this is the most completed ever a work could be. aspire, adore, appreciate. be thankful of whats done before you. shit in your trousers. attune, ascend, escalate situations for interdimensional drama to occur, i have words to spew when it comes to Glorbiosa Glorbus Glorg the Third.</p>
<a href="charmcalc/hkcharms.html">Hollow knight charm combination count calculator for the ultra nerd voidlings. (work in progress or some shit, last updated: may 2024. wow! still lacks the stupid knapsack thing eh? i solved like hundereds of leetcode. dont you fucking blame me i didnt solve it in j*vascript, i solved all in p*thon like a petite little bitch)</a>

<p>this site is brought to you by lacking styling or dynamicness or basically anything gang. pay the deed a dime damn respect, donations of money are still to be implemented.</p>
<p>you think i would beg for you only for "customer purchase power"??? no. im off the grids, off the money scheme. whenever i feel like it i trade blueberries. very rich in antioxidants</p>
<p>itd be wiser to actually have this site some nice place instead of random bullshit since, yk, employers see this right? theres statistically 0 chance someone else sees it. if you see it while not being an employer, send me death threats on my mail box</p>
<p>i will make this into a blog. some day. dont keep up with me. i have knives i made and self made weapons, seek me at your own risk (oh no please dont)</p>
<p>i am peaceful as fuck though, like come boop my nose or some shit, a nonchalant capybara type shit.</p>
<p>just dont have evil intentions. my nose is very sensetive to evil intentions, more than yours is to petrichor or a sharks is to blood.</p>
<p>avoid communication with me at all costs. communication includes seeing my github page, seeing and reading this stupid site, crying or hiding emotions, talking me up front, knocking the door on my door of my house where i keep all my buzzsaws which is boobytrapped to the brim. failure to comply will make you a better person at worst.</p>
<p>if you are somehow curious about me, i have been pouring hydrochloric acid over your legs all this time. see you later in earths magma.</p>
